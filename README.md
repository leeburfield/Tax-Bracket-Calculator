# Tax-Bracket-Calculator
My first program, a basic tax bracket calculator. The next addition will include an income tax % calculator.
I'll keep adding here, the calculators I build and I guess they'll serve as an addition to my resume.
I'm learning C coding; teaching myself. I'm interested in cyber security, and I think I want to start a penetration testing company;
I think I'll have a knack for it :P

I don't want to take up your time because you don't owe me anything, but I'm hoping you get a kick out of this.
I really don't deserve it, but if you ever want to have a chat, I would really like that.
